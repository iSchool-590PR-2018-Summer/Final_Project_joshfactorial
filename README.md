# 590PR Final_Project
Fork from here to create your final project repository.

Two things are different than all the previous assignments in 590PR regarding the permissions settings:

1. Please KEEP the "All_Students" team to have Read access.  
2. Whenever you choose to, you are welcome to change your Final Project repository to public.  This will enable you to list it in your resume, website, or other portfolio.

DELETE these lines from TEMPLATE up.
